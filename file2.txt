Q What are loop and what do we needs them ? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and explames .

Ans = A loop in programming is a control structure that allows a set of instructions or a code block to be executed repeatedly until a specified
 condition is met or an exit statement is reached.

 In programming, a loop is a way to perform repetitive tasks elegantly using a specified structure. The importance of loops in programming can be 
 attributed to the following reasons:

 => Code reusability: Loops eliminate the need for writing the same code multiple times, making your code shorter and easier to manage.
 => Efficiency: Loops efficiently handle repetitive tasks without the need to slow down the program or use excessive memory.
=> Flexibility: Loops can be easily adjusted to work with different scenarios and varying amounts of data or tasks.
=> Easier troubleshooting: By implementing loops correctly, errors become easier to locate and fix, as the same code block is reused in each
     iteration.

  =>   For loop	When the number of iterations is known or fixed.
=>   While loop	When the loop should only be executed if a specific condition holds true.
 => Do-while loop	When the loop should be executed at least once and continue as long as the condition is true.
